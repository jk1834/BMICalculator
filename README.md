# BMICalculator
 
## Installation
The installation process for this program is extremely simple. Download the repository, and save it wherever you want with whatever filename you desire. 

## Running the Program
The only step left is to put the program wherever directory you want it to be and double click the html file. Hosting the application on a web server is the next priority, but for now, it simply sits in an html file.

##  Using the Program
While the instructions are listed plainly and clearly in the program, all it boils down to is inputting two imperial numbers in the boxes, and hitting the calculate button. For more in depth instructions, see the "Instructions" tab on the application itself.
